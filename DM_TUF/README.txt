The files are structured as follows:

The quickstart directory contains all the files generated by signercli to be run on the server side.  We used nginx or SimpleHTTPServer running on port 8080

The tuftest directory contains the files required to run the client.  The client side proxy server runs 127.0.0.8080
It is invoked by entering mitmdump -es interpose.py on the client terminal within the tuftest directory.
