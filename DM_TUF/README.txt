The directories and files are structured as follows:

The quickstart directory contains all the files generated by the scripts to be run on the server side.  We used nginx running on port 80

The tuftest directory contains the files required to run the client.  The client side server runs at 127.0.0.1:8080
It is invoked by entering python svr.py on the client terminal within the tuftest directory.

The server directory contains the configuration file for nginx.  Three servers are run simultaneously:

128.238.64.154:80 is the ip address for the server feeding TUF data at normal speed
In order to use this, the app.update.url.override string in the about:config firefox configuration file is set to the default setting of app.update.url,
except that http is used rather than https and the ip:port is set to 127.0.0.1:8080
The tuf.interposition.json file has mirror1.poly.edu mapped into url prefix of http://128.238.64.154:80


128.238.64.154:8080 is the ip address for the server feeding TUF data at reduced speed to simulate a slow retrieval attack.
In order to use this, the app.update.url.override string in the about:config firefox configuration file is set to the default setting of app.update.url,
except that http is used rather than https and the ip:port is set to 127.0.0.1:8080
The tuf.interposition.json file should be modified to have mirror1.poly.edu mapped into url prefix of http://128.238.64.154:8080


128.238.64.154:8000 is the ip address for loading files for windows, linux, and ubuntu without using TUF
To download the unix update for firefox, app.update.url.override is set to http://128.238.64.154:8000/nottuf/linux/update.xml
To download the windows update for firefox, app.update.url.override is set to http://128.238.64.154:8000/nottuf/windows/update.xml 
To download the ubuntu update for firefox, app.update.url.override is set to http://128.238.64.154:8000/nottuf/ubuntu/update.xml

The nottuf directory contains the update files for use when not using tuf.

The Slow Retrival Snapshots directory containst the snapshots taken for windows when performing slow retrieval attacks.

The Firefox_bin directory contains the base binaries for firefox under ubuntu and windows.  They need to be installed prior to attempting updates.
