The files are structured as follows:

The quickstart directory contains all the files generated by signercli to be run on the server side.  We used nginx or SimpleHTTPServer running on port 80

The tuftest directory contains the files required to run the client.  The client side proxy server runs at 127.0.0.1:8080
It is invoked by entering python svr.py on the client terminal within the tuftest directory.

The configuration of firefox must first be changed by adding a configuration string named app.update.url.override.  The value of this will be the same
as that of app.update.url, except that http is used rather than https and the ip:port is set to 127.0.0.1.:8080
